** In Revision State (Casper)

Expositions can be put in revision.
This means:
- The author can edit the content again
- The reviewers can still view it, but status is shown.
- Either the author or the admin can "lock" the exposition back to "in review".
- This solves a problem where expositions "go missing" after something is changed.

*** In revision dialog (administrator)
