** In Revision State

Expositions can now be put "in revision" state.

This means:
- The author can edit the content.
- However, the exposition remains in the list for the admin.
- Reviewers can still view it, but it is listed with an "in revision" status.
- Either the author or the admin can return the exposition into "review" state.
- This solves a problem where expositions "go missing" after something is changed.
