* MODULE : Repository / API

** PART I : Repostory

*** Works (as currently):

- Reuse of materials between expositions
- Allows for uploading single files, without an exposition
- Additional meta-data
- Represents a real-world artwork or event

*** Media Repostory (to be implemented):

Extends the work concept: 

- Any object can annotate another object
- Annotation can be specific to a location a complete object
- One click upload
- Bulk upload
- Collaboration / sharing / citing

*** Annotation pointers

Media can be annotated using pointers.
The annotating object can be a work itself, or a text.


*** Annotation types
 
- Reference
- Description
- Comment
- Realization
- Representation

*** Annotation pointer types:

- Time (audio and video)
- Position (image)
- Character position (text)

** API

*** Why an API?

- Custom editors and imports (example: text-based editor, madek import)
- Generating "meta" expositions based on content
- Automating administrative tasks (registering large amount of users)
- Export/Backup portal content
- Modular development
- Transparancy
- Linking with networks
