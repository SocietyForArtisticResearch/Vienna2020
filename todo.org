** Media Repostiroy/API (Casper)

*** Repository

Works (as currently):

- Reuse of materials between expositions
- Allows for uploading single files, without an exposition
- Additional meta-data
- Represents a real-world artwork or event

Media Repostory

Should do all of the above

- One click upload
- Bulk upload
- Any object can annotate another object.
- Annotation can be specific or to the object as a whole.

*** Annotation pointers

- Time (audio and video)
- Position (image)
- Character position (text)

*** Annotation types
 
- Reference
- Description
- Comment
- Realization
- Representation

*** API

*** Why an API?

- Custom editors and imports (example: Text-based editor, Madek import)
- Generating "meta" expositions based on content
- Automating administrative tasks (registering large amount of users)
- Export/Backup portal content
- Modular development
- Transparancy
- Linking with networks
