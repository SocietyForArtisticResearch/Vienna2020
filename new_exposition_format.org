* MODULE: New Exposition Format 

** Motivations

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Facilitate manifold workflows
- Research tool and documentation tool
- Programmability
- Archivability 
- Specification
- Expressing relation between data objects
- Spatialized knowledge

** Workflow

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Collecting data
- Writing text
- Tagging data
- Creating relations among data
- Visualizing realtions

** Relations

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Data (such as text, media objects, etc.) can be related 
  - Visually (above, below, etc.)
  - Temporally (after, before, etc.)
  - Semantically (annotation, comment, reference, representation, etc.)   
- Networks of relation can be *rendered*
- Multiple layers of relations

** Ontology

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Exposition as a set of relations among data
- Specification of fundamental structure and vocabularies
- Queryable data object
- Linked data
- Validation and dependencies

** Renderers

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Multiple rendering engines (PDF, HTML, responsive, temporal sequence, epub, SVG etc.)
- Different purposes: curated path, archive, "print out", responsive page, programmed application
- Not all properties will be rendered by all renderers

** Reading Process

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- New navigation and exploration tools
- Searching, filtering, rearranging
- Embedding and linking with external resources
- "Meta-expositions"
- Curated paths/arrangements
- Social aspects: collective notes, discussions, tracing the reading processes in the exposition

** Writing Process

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Rendering, reading and writing as entangled practices
- Visualization (mindmap, graph etc.) can reveal properties and establish new connections
- The writing process can help discover something about the work
- Author can decide on the degree of mutability


** Roadmap

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Definition of the ontology
- Gradual integration into the editors
- Editing relations
